The new issues raised in the GitHub are triaged and sized weekly in the Wednesday Squad meetings. There is an [Open Mainframe Project Zowe calendar](https://lists.openmainframeproject.org/calendar) with the squad meetings.

To get a better understanding on the complexity of different issues, we use a modified Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100) as the number of the points to size each issue.  
Here is an baseline to give a sizing for issues:
1. Find a small issue that would take about a half-day to develop and a half-day to test and validate, and call it a ‘one’ point. 
2. Estimate every other issue relative to that ‘one’ point.
3. For every full-time developer and tester on the team, give the team 8 points in each sprint (adjust for part-timers). 
4. For the issue that is larger than 8 points, we can split it into smaller issues.
